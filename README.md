# Jiancheng Yang's Personal Website
A programmer programs everything including his/her personal page :) 

This page is styled with [jemdoc](https://jemdoc.jaboc.net/) but highly customized with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). The page is responsive thanks to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). It is compatible to most modern browsers, except for IE.


## How-To
If you would like to customize your website with this template, you may find this project very easy to use. As I almost refactor (almost) all personal information in a seperate file (thanks to Vue.js), basically you only need to:

1. Fork this project;
2. Update the header and page tracker (search `site.showPageviews`) in [index.html](index.html);
    [Important!] Please update the page tracker with yours! Otherwise you are indeed using mine. Thanks ;)
3. Update [data.js](data.js) with your own information;
4. Of course you could also customize all components with html, css and js by your own;
5. Customize [CNAME](CNAME) with your own domain (or delete it).
